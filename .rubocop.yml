# DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE unless you want to deviate from the rubocop_plus ruleset.

# This file defines the settings used by rubocop when it runs. You would normally add your customizations directly to this
# file, but this file has been pre configured to read settings out of the rubocop_plus gem instead.

# Tell rubocop to load its settings from the rubocop_plus gem.

inherit_gem:
  rubocop_plus: config/rubocop.yml

# Place custom settings below this comment. All customizations will OVERRIDE rubocop_plus rules. rubocop_plus & rubocop
# do not attempt to merge these settings with their defaults. Long term changes should be ported to the rubocop_plus gem.
